			<p>Zone Lockdown allows you to allow specific IP addresses and IP ranges whereby all other IPs are effectively blocked. This is best used to protect an Administrative area of a website to, e.g. an office or VPN.</p>
			<p>Zone Lockdown supports:<br>Specific sub-domains, allowing you to, for example, allow IP 1.2.3.4 to access domain foo.example.com and allow IP 5.6.7.8 to access domain bar.example.com, but not necessarily allow the vice versa.<br>Specific URLs, allowing you to, for example, allow IP 1.2.3.4 to access directory example.com/foo/<em> and allow IP 5.6.7.8 to access directory example.com/bar/</em>, but not necessarily allow the vice versa.<br>This is useful when you need more granularity in your IP Access Rules since, with the IP Firewall, you can only either apply the block to all sub-domains of the current domain, or all domains on your account, and you can not specify URIs.</p>
			<p>Advanced Options:<br>In a scenario where you have multiple Zone Lockdown rules, which overlap, you can set a priority to ensure one Zone Lockdown rule is honored over another. For example, if you protected example.com/admin/<em> but also had example.com/admin/api/</em> - and the users to API had a different set of IP allowed IP addresses, then this would keep this area protected.</p>
			<p>The <em>lower</em> the number, the <em>higher</em> the priority. Higher priority rules take precedence over those with lower priority.</p>
