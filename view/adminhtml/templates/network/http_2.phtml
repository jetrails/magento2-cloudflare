			<h4>What is HTTP/2?</h4>
			<p><a target="blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/http2/what-is-http2/" >HTTP/2</a> is a major revision of the Web’s protocol designed for low-latency transport of content over the World Wide Web.</p>
			<p>HTTP/2 improves the way HTTP requests and responses are sent allowing for faster page load times.</p>
			<p>HTTP/2 improves page load times by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Connection multiplexing: Multiple resources can be retrieved in a single network request. Responses are sent when resources are available (sometimes out of order), to avoid slowing down page rendering.</li>
				<li>HTTP header compression: HTTP requests are simplified to avoid resending headers, and compression is applied to headers that must be sent.</li>
				<li>HTTP/2 Server Push: Allows Cloudflare to provide content to clients without waiting for a request. This can improve the time to retrieve a resource by “pushing” the responses it thinks the client will need into its cache.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Keep in mind:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Not all browsers support HTTP/2. These browsers will leverage HTTP 1.x instead</li>
				<li>HTTP/2 requires a valid SSL certificate and is only available over TLS</li>
				<li>Connection multiplexing is on a per-domain basis</li>
				<li>The connection from Cloudflare to your origin will be made over HTTP 1.x</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note</strong>: Rocket Loader can further improve connection multiplexing in HTTP/2 by allowing resources hosted on different domains to be retrieved in a single network request. Without Rocket Loader, if a website has resources that are hosted on a different domain, separate HTTP/2 connections will need to be made for resources on each domain. While HTTP/2 is not supported between the Cloudflare network and the customer origin, Cloudflare Railgun provides similar benefits for connection multiplexing and HTTP header compression on this connection.</p>
