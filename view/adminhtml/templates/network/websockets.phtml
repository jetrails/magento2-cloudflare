			<h4>What are WebSockets?</h4>
			<p>WebSockets are open connections sustained between the client and the origin server. Inside a WebSockets connection, the client and the origin can pass data back and forth without having to reestablish sessions. This makes exchanging data within a WebSockets connection fast. WebSockets are often used for real-time applications such as live chat and gaming.</p>
			<h4>Why use WebSockets?</h4>
			<p>Because WebSockets creates a single connection and doesn’t need multiple HTTP headers, WebSockets can provide anywhere from 500:1 to a 1000:1 reduction in unnecessary HTTP header traffic compared to HTTP polling solutions.</p>
			<p>The server no longer needs to wait for a request to come back before it sends new data; it can simply push the data to the client the moment it has new information. Tests have shown a 3:1 reduction in latency compared to polling solutions.</p>
			<p>For more technical information on the WebSockets, you can read up on the <a target="blank" href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/comms.html#network" >HTML5 Web Sockets Specification.</a></p>
			<h4>How can I use WebSockets with Cloudflare?</h4>
			<p>No additional configuration is required to send WebSockets traffic through Cloudflare. Cloudflare will immediately begin proxying your WebSockets through to your origin.</p>
			<h4>Can I use WebSockets over SSL?</h4>
			<p>Yes. WebSockets through Cloudflare are fully compatible with Cloudflare’s SSL.</p>
