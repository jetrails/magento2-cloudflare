			<p>You can resize, adjust quality, and convert images to WebP format, on demand. We cache every derived image at the edge, so you store only the original image.</p>
			<p>This allows you to adapt images to your site's layout and your visitors' screen sizes, quickly and easily, without maintaining a server-side image processing pipeline.</p>

			<h4>What does Image Resizing do?</h4>
			<p>Resizing fetches the original image and caches it (following the usual rules of HTTP caching, Cache-Control header, etc.). Requests for multiple different image sizes are likely to reuse the cached original image, without causing extra transfers from the origin server.</p>
			<p>Resized images follow the same caching rules as the original image and their Cache-Control header is identical. We do not support purging of resized variants.  Purging of the original image URL will also purge all of its resized variants.</p>
			<h4>What does 'Resize images from any origin' do?</h4>
			<p> 'Resize images from any origin' will allow Image Resizing to resize images from any URI.<br>I.e. howtospeedupmagento.com will serve resized images originating from any URI, whether howtospeedupmagento.com or elsewhere.</p>
			<p>By default, Image Resizing will only resize images which originate from this zone, howtospeedupmagento.com.<br>I.e. howtospeedupmagento.com will serve resized images only if the images originate from howtospeedupmagento.com.</p>
			<h4>Using Workers</h4>
			<p>'Resize images from any origin' is not valid when using a Worker for Image Resizing. The Worker is expected to apply its own policies dictating which images will be resized.</p>
