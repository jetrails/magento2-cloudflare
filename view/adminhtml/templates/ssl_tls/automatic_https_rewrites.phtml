			<h4>Why Should I use Automatic HTTPS Rewrites?</h4>
			<p>If your site contains links or references to HTTP URLs that are also available securely via HTTPS, Automatic HTTPS Rewrites can help. If you connect to your site over HTTPS and the lock icon is not present, or has a yellow warning triangle on it, your site may contain references to HTTP assets (“mixed content”).</p>
			<p>Mixed content is often due to factors not under the website owner’s control such as embedded third-party content or complex content management systems. By rewriting URLs from “http” to “https”, Automatic HTTPS Rewrites simplifies the task of making your entire website available over HTTPS, helping to eliminate mixed content errors and ensuring that all data loaded by your website is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.</p>
			<h4>Does Automatic HTTPS Rewrites fix all mixed content errors?</h4>
			<p>No. Only URLs that are known to support HTTPS will be rewritten. We use data from EFF’s HTTPS Everywhere and Chrome’s HSTS preload list, among others, to identify which domains support HTTPS. If your zone is not on one of these lists, only active content will be rewritten. Passive content (such as images) will not be rewritten and will still cause mixed content errors.</p>
